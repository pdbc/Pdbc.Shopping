# Validation

Every application's stability and robustness comes forward with its ability to provide good and early validation.  In this application I've opted for the fluent validation package which allows easy to write validations, but more importantly easy to read validations.

> You will always read your code more than you have to write it.  That is as well one of the reasons fluent interfaces (validation, but as well the builders) are so important to your codebase.
